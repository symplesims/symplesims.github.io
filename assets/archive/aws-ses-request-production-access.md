Subject: Request for AWS SES Production Access Approval

Hello AWS SES Support Team,

We, at [Company Name], are planning to use AWS SES to send emails to our customers, and we would like to request an upgrade from SES sandbox mode to production access. Below, please find the details of our email sending operations and policies:

1. SES Usage
We utilize AWS SES to send email invitations for new member registrations, provide customer support communications, and distribute periodic reports.

2. Email Delivery Frequency
An email is automatically sent upon the completion of the member registration process, and our system sends up to 500 emails per day.

3. Bounce and Complaint Handling
We actively monitor email performance using the Bounce Rate metric provided by SES. Bounced emails are automatically added to our Suppression List, and accounts with persistent issues are processed as dormant in our application.

4. Unsubscription Management
Each email includes an unsubscribe URL. Recipients who choose to opt out are promptly removed from our mailing list through our automated unsubscription management system.

5. Personal Information Protection
We strictly adhere to data protection regulations, including ISMS-P, ensuring that recipient privacy and data security are top priorities.

We maintain strict internal policies and an automated monitoring system for our email operations and recipient management. We believe that upgrading to production access will enable us to establish a more stable and efficient email communication system. We appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive review of our request.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
